## What is programming useful for {.smaller}

-   Programming is the act of instructing computers to perform specific tasks by writing code using programming languages (such as Python, Java, C++ or...**R**)
-   Why should we doing this as social scientists ?
    -   Collect, manipulate, reshape and clean data
    -   Visualize data by creating beautiful plots
    -   Computing descriptive statistics (such as mean, median, crosstabs..)
    -   Analyse data through statistical modelling
    -   And many other things...
-   But why not other tools such as SPSS/STATA ?

## Free and open source

## Reproducibility



## Rise of Computational social sciences

-   CSS as interdisciplinary field employing computational tools and data to adress questions relevant to social sciences
-   Proliferation of digital data, increasing computational power, advances in AI : opportunities for social sciences
-   Few exemples requiring programming :
    -   Web scraping
    -   Machine Learning
    -   Text, image and audio as data

## Valuable skills on the job market


## Programming as a qualitative researcher {.smaller}

-   Programming is commonly linked with quantitative research because automation is really helpful when we have large datasets

-   Programming can be intimidating for more qualitative researcher but...a few reasons to learn those skills

    1.  Allow yourself to be surprised (.eg unexpected datasets on your topic)
    2.  Contextualizing qualitative data (eg. Plots and descriptives)
    3.  Collecting data (eg. web scraping)
    4.  Formatting data (eg. OCR, speech-to-text algorithms such as Whisper)
    5.  Analyzing data (eg. automated text analysis)

## R vs Python ?

-   R : stastical focus, efficient for data manipulation and modelling, widespread in social sciences
-   Python : general-purpose programming language, popular in industry, essential for new stuff in machine learning
-   At one point, if you are interested in data science, learn both.

Let's turn to RStudio to practice!
